It updates the policy in the direction that maximizes rewards, using full-episode returns as an unbiased estimate of the gradient. Each step involves generating an episode using the current policy, computing the gradient estimate, and updating the policy parameters. This algorithm is simple yet powerful, and it's particularly effective in environments where the policy gradient is noisy or the dynamics are complex.\n",

    "\n",
    "In the basic REINFORCE algorithm, the policy parameters are updated in proportion to the product of the gradient of the policy log-probability and the cumulative reward (return) from a state-action pair. However, this approach can lead to high variance in policy updates, making learning slower and less stable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline is introduced to reduce this variance. It is a value subtracted from the cumulative reward when calculating the policy gradient. The key property of the baseline is that it does not affect the expected value of the gradient estimate, which means it doesn't bias the learning process but reduces the variance of the updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The baseline can be thought of as a reference point or an \"average\" expectation of reward. By comparing the actual rewards to this baseline, we can determine whether the outcomes of certain actions are better or worse than this \"average\" performance.\n",

Then, for each training episode, it generates an episode using the current policy and calculates the return at each time step. It uses this return, the log probability of the action taken at that time step, and the estimated value of the state to compute the policy and value losses. These losses are used to update the policy and value network parameters using gradient ascent. The value loss is typically defined as the squared difference between the estimated return and the actual return."

    "The REINFORCE agent we've implemented so far is designed for environments with discrete action spaces. However, policy-based methods can effectively handle large, even continuous, action spaces. Instead of calculating learned probabilities for each possible action, we learn the statistics of the probability distribution. For instance, if the action set comprises real numbers, actions could be chosen from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.\n",

The mean and standard deviation of this distribution are determined by parametric function approximators (the `PolicyNetwork` neural network) that depend on the state.\n",

    "We can divide the policy’s parameter vector, $\\boldsymbol{\\theta} = [ \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\mu, \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_\\sigma ]^\\top$, into two parts: one for approximating the mean and the other for approximating the standard deviation.\n",
