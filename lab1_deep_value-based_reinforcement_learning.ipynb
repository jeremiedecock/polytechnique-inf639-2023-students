    "## Deep value-based reinforcement learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep reinforcement learning methods like DQN (Deep Q-Networks) are significant advancements over tabular methods such as Q-Learning because they can handle complex, high-dimensional environments that were previously intractable. While Q-Learning is limited to environments where the state and action spaces are sufficiently small to maintain a table of values, DQN uses neural networks to approximate the Q-value function, allowing it to generalize across similar states and scale to problems with vast state spaces. This enables DQN to learn optimal policies for tasks like video games, robotic control, and other applications where the number of possible states is extraordinarily large.\n",
    "\n",
    "While DQN was designed to tackle large environments like Atari games, the primary focus of this lab is to delve into the underlying algorithms, understand them thoroughly, and evaluate them comprehensively. It's important to note that working with not-so-deep networks captures the essence of deep reinforcement learning, excluding the computational expense. The transition from tabular Q-learning to DQN involves significant implications, primarily due to the ability of DQN to handle high-dimensional state spaces. Moving from DQN to very-deep-DQN is primarily a matter of scale and computational resources. The core principles remain the same, and understanding these principles is the key to mastering reinforcement learning, regardless of the complexity of the network used.\n",
    "For these reasons, in this lab, we will focus on studying the CartPole environment. The CartPole problem is a classic in reinforcement learning, and it provides a simpler and more manageable context for understanding the principles of DQN. The convergence in the CartPole environment is much faster than in Atari games - typically within a minute, as opposed to approximately 10 hours on a well-equipped personal computer for Atari games. This allows us to experiment and iterate more quickly, facilitating a deeper understanding of the algorithms at play."

    "## Why It Doesn't Work: The Complexity of Deep Reinforcement Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "Our initial deep value-based agent did not converge, primarily due to the three fundamental challenges of value-based deep reinforcement learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Coverage**: Convergence to the optimal Q-function relies on comprehensive coverage of the state space. However, in the context of deep RL, the state space is often too large to be fully covered. In situations where not all states are sampled due to their vast number, the guarantee of convergence no longer holds.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Correlation**: The probability of transitioning to the next state is highly influenced by the current state. This strong correlation can lead to local overfitting and the risk of becoming trapped in a local optimum: the neural network, which approximates the Q-function, may become overly specialized in a small portion of the action-state space and neglect the rest.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convergence**: The \"targets\" used as the truth to be achieved \"move\" during the learning process. For the same prediction (estimation of the value of a state-action pair, i.e., its Q-value), the loss of a given example changes during the learning process (due to *bootstrapping* a main concept of TD-Learning). In other words, DQN tries to minimize a moving target, a target that depends on the model we are learning and optimizing. This can lead to instability and make it difficult for the learning process to converge to an optimal policy.\n",

    "In the following sections, we will explore strategies to address these challenges and improve the performance of our deep reinforcement learning agent."

    "Experience replay addresses these issues by storing the agent's experiences, i.e., the tuples of (state, action, reward, next state), in a data structure known as a replay buffer. During the learning process, instead of learning from the most recent experience, the agent randomly samples a batch of experiences from the replay buffer. This random sampling breaks the correlation between successive experiences, leading to more stable and robust learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, by learning from past experiences, the agent can effectively learn from a fixed target, which mitigates the issue of learning from a moving target. This is because the experiences in the replay buffer remain fixed once they are stored, even though the agent's policy continues to evolve."

    "In a typical DQN setup, there are two neural networks: the Q-network and the target network. The Q-network is used to predict the Q-values and is updated at every time step. The target network is used to compute the target Q-values for the update, and its weights are updated less frequently, typically every few thousand steps, by copying the weights from the Q-network.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind infrequent weight updates is to stabilize the learning process by keeping the target Q-values fixed for a number of steps. This mitigates the issue of learning from a moving target, as the target Q-values remain fixed between updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without infrequent weight updates, both the predicted and target Q-values would change at every step, which could lead to oscillations and divergence in the learning process. By introducing a delay between updates of the target Q-values, the risk of such oscillations is reduced."

    "Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) is an enhancement to the traditional experience replay mechanism used in Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) and other reinforcement learning algorithms. In traditional experience replay, experiences (or transitions) are stored in a replay buffer, and mini-batches are sampled uniformly at random from this buffer to update the agent's Q-network. This means every experience has the same probability of being chosen, regardless of its significance to the learning process.\n",

    "\n",
    "To switch from a DQN to a DQN with Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), you need to make a few modifications to the *DQN 2015* agent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Experience Replay Buffer**: Replace the standard experience replay buffer with a prioritized one. This buffer should store experiences with a priority value that is updated after each learning step. The priority value is usually the absolute TD error plus a small constant to avoid experiences having zero probability of being chosen.\n",
    "2. **Sampling Method**: Change the sampling method from uniform to prioritized sampling. This means experiences with higher priority values have a higher probability of being chosen for learning.\n",
    "3. **Loss Function**: Modify the loss function to include importance sampling weights. These weights compensate for the bias introduced by the non-uniform sampling. The weight of each sampled experience is the inverse of its probability of being chosen.\n",

    "## Bonus: Gradient clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient clipping is a technique used to tackle the problem of exploding gradients in deep learning, including in the context of Reinforcement Learning. In reinforcement learning, the distribution of rewards and therefore gradients can be highly variable. Large updates to the Q-network weights can destabilize training, leading to divergence. Gradient clipping limits the size of the weight updates, ensuring stable and more reliable learning. By preventing erratic and large updates, gradient clipping can help the learning process converge more smoothly and often more quickly to a stable policy. DQN uses experience replay to break the correlation between successive updates. However, the mixed nature of the experiences can lead to high variance in gradients. Clipping gradients in this context ensures that even if there is a harmful experience in the replay buffer, it does not disproportionately affect the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient clipping can be implemented using `torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value_` between the `loss.backward()` and the `optimizer.step()` as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",

    "torch.nn.utils.clip_grad_value_(q_network.parameters(), clip_grad_value)  # In-place gradient clipping\n",

    "\n",
    "**Task 7.1:** Implement gradient clipping in your existing DQN training routines. Once integrated, conduct a series of experiments to evaluate the impact of this technique on the learning stability and convergence of your models. Log the maximum gradient norm just before each update to the Q-network weights, providing a quantitative measure of the gradients' magnitude. Additionally, produce visualizations such as plots to illustrate the effect of gradient clipping on these norms over time."

    "### Dueling DDQN (DDDQN) : Advantage function\n",
    "\n",
    "Dueling Double DQN (Dueling DDQN) is an enhancement over the standard DQN that aims to improve the quality of the learned value function (https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06581). The motivation for Dueling DDQN lies in its architecture, which separately estimates two components: the value of being in a particular state (V(s)), and the advantage of taking a particular action in that state (A(s, a)).\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard DQN, a single stream of network layers estimates the Q-value directly. In contrast, Dueling DDQN has two streams to separately estimate the value and advantage functions, which are then combined to calculate the Q-value. This allows the network to more effectively learn which states are (or are not) valuable without having to learn the effect of each action for each state. This is particularly useful in environments where the value of the state does not vary much across actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The separation of the estimation process helps in stabilizing learning and often leads to better policy evaluation, especially in cases where the action choice does not have a large impact on what happens next—making Dueling DDQN a more robust and often more efficient learning algorithm compared to the standard DQN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Distributional methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Distributional Q-Learning enhances the standard DQN by modeling the entire distribution of possible future rewards, rather than simply estimating the expected reward (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06887). The motivation for Distributional Q-Learning stems from the insight that the uncertainty in rewards—and consequently in the value function—can provide valuable information that is not captured when only the mean expected reward is considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard DQN approximates the expected value of the total return (the sum of future discounted rewards) from a given state-action pair. However, this approach ignores the variability around this expected value. In contrast, Distributional Q-Learning represents the value function as a distribution over possible returns, capturing the full range of potential outcomes and their probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "This richer representation allows the agent to distinguish between actions that may lead to the same expected reward but with different risks or variances in outcomes. It enables more informed decision-making in stochastic environments, where the variability of returns is as important as the expectation. By capturing the entire distribution, Distributional Q-Learning can also potentially converge faster and yield more robust policies, as it accounts for the variance in rewards that can be critical in the learning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NoisyNets DQN\n",
    "\n",
    "Noisy DQN introduces parametric noise directly into the weights of the neural network to drive exploration, as opposed to traditional methods like ϵϵ-greedy where the randomness is injected into the action selection process (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.10295). The key motivation behind Noisy DQN is to enable more sophisticated and efficient exploration strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "In standard DQN, exploration is often implemented through ϵϵ-greedy policies that select random actions with a certain probability ϵϵ, which can be suboptimal and inefficient, especially as ϵϵ has to be carefully decayed over time to balance exploration with exploitation. This randomness is external and does not adapt based on the agent’s experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "Noisy DQN, however, incorporates noise into the network’s parameters, making the policy itself stochastic. This approach allows the network to learn the degree of exploration needed from the environment feedback, as the noise can be learned and adapted during training. It provides a more nuanced exploration mechanism that can potentially learn to explore in a state-dependent manner, leading to faster and more robust convergence of the learning process."
